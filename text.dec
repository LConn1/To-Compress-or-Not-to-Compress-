"It was only a meeting assembled for an election.""The election of a general-in-chief, no doubt?" asked Mr. Fogg."No, sir; of a justice of the peace."Phileas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full speed.Chapter XXVIIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD"From ocean to ocean"--so say the Americans; and these four wordscompose the general designation of the "great trunk line" which crossesthe entire width of the United States.  The Pacific Railroad is,however, really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific,between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogdenand Omaha.  Five main lines connect Omaha with New York.New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metalribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred andeighty-six miles.  Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses aterritory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts, and alarge tract which the Mormons, after they were driven from Illinois in1845, began to colonise.The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, underthe most favourable conditions, at least six months.  It is nowaccomplished in seven days.It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, whowished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road betweenthe forty-first and forty-second parallels.  President Lincoln himselffixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska.  The work was at oncecommenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapiditywith which it went on injuriously affect its good execution.  The roadgrew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day.  A locomotive, runningon the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laidon the morrow, and advanced upon them as fast as they were put inposition.The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa, Kansas,Colorado, and Oregon.  On leaving Omaha, it passes along the left bankof the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch,follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie territory and theWahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake, and reaches Salt LakeCity, the Mormon capital, plunges into the Tuilla Valley, across theAmerican Desert, Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, anddescends, via Sacramento, to the Pacific--its grade, even on the RockyMountains, never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile.Such was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would enablePhileas Fogg--at least, so he hoped--to take the Atlantic steamer atNew York on the 11th for Liverpool.The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels,and with no compartments in the interior.  It was supplied with tworows of seats, perpendicular to the direction of the train on eitherside of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms.These platforms were found throughout the train, and the passengerswere able to pass from one end of the train to the other.  It wassupplied with saloon cars, balcony cars, restaurants, and smoking-cars;theatre cars alone were wanting, and they will have these some day.Book and news dealers, sellers of edibles, drinkables, and cigars, whoseemed to have plenty of customers, were continually circulating in theaisles.The train left Oakland station at six o'clock.  It was already night,cold and cheerless, the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemedto threaten snow.  The train did not proceed rapidly; counting thestoppages, it did not run more than twenty miles an hour, which was asufficient speed, however, to enable it to reach Omaha within itsdesignated time.There was but little conversation in the car, and soon many of thepassengers were overcome with sleep.  Passepartout found himself besidethe detective; but he did not talk to him.  After recent events, theirrelations with each other had grown somewhat cold; there could nolonger be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them.  Fix's manner hadnot changed; but Passepartout was very reserved, and ready to stranglehis former friend on the slightest provocation.Snow began to fall an hour after they started, a fine snow, however,which happily could not obstruct the train; nothing could be seen fromthe windows but a vast, white sheet, against which the smoke of thelocomotive had a greyish aspect.At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that the timefor going to bed had arrived; and in a few minutes the car wastransformed into a dormitory.  The backs of the seats were thrown back,bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system,berths were suddenly improvised, and each traveller had soon at hisdisposition a comfortable bed, protected from curious eyes by thickcurtains.  The sheets were clean and the pillows soft.  It onlyremained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did--while the trainsped on across the State of California.The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly.The Central Pacific, taking Sacramento for its starting-point, extendseastward to meet the road from Omaha.  The line from San Francisco toSacramento runs in a north-easterly direction, along the AmericanRiver, which empties into San Pablo Bay.  The one hundred and twentymiles between these cities were accomplished in six hours, and towardsmidnight, while fast asleep, the travellers passed through Sacramento;so that they saw nothing of that important place, the seat of the Stategovernment, with its fine quays, its broad streets, its noble hotels,squares, and churches.The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, Roclin,Auburn, and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra Nevada.  'Cisco wasreached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory wastransformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers could observe thepicturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they weresteaming.  The railway track wound in and out among the passes, nowapproaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices, avoidingabrupt angles by bold curves, plunging into narrow defiles, whichseemed to have no outlet.  The locomotive, its great funnel emitting aweird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like aspur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents andcascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines.There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route.  The railwayturned around the sides of the mountains, and did not attempt toviolate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another.The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley aboutnine o'clock, going always northeasterly; and at midday reached Reno,where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast.From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passednorthward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward, andkept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, nearly at theextreme eastern limit of Nevada.Having breakfasted, Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places inthe car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself asthey passed along the vast prairies, the mountains lining the horizon,and the creeks, with their frothy, foaming streams.  Sometimes a greatherd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like amoveable dam.  These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts oftenform an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousandsof them have been seen passing over the track for hours together, incompact ranks.  The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till theroad is once more clear.This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffaloencumbered the track.  The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried toclear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was toogreat.  The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering nowand then deafening bellowings.  There was no use of interrupting them,for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate andchange their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam couldcontain.The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; butPhileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remainedin his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please thebuffaloes to get out of the way.Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed todischarge his arsenal of revolvers upon them."What a country!" cried he.  "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by ina procession, just as if they were not impeding travel!  Parbleu!  Ishould like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into thisherd of beasts!"The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.  Hewould have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with the cow-catcher;but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon have been checked, thetrain would inevitably have been thrown off the track, and would thenhave been helpless.The best course was to wait patiently, and regain the lost time bygreater speed when the obstacle was removed.  The procession ofbuffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the trackwas clear.  The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails,while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon.It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of theHumboldt Range, and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah, the regionof the Great Salt Lake, the singular colony of the Mormons.Chapter XXVIIIN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT UNDERGOES, AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES AN HOUR, ACOURSE OF MORMON HISTORYDuring the night of the 5th of December, the train ran south-easterlyfor about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterlydirection, towards the Great Salt Lake.Passepartout, about nine o'clock, went out upon the platform to takethe air.  The weather was cold, the heavens grey, but it was notsnowing.  The sun's disc, enlarged by the mist, seemed an enormous ringof gold, and Passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its valuein pounds sterling, when he was diverted from this interesting study bya strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform.This personage, who had taken the train at Elko, was tall and dark,with black moustache, black stockings, a black silk hat, a blackwaistcoat, black trousers, a white cravat, and dogskin gloves.  Hemight have been taken for a clergyman.  He went from one end of thetrain to the other, and affixed to the door of each car a noticewritten in manuscript.Passepartout approached and read one of these notices, which statedthat Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary, taking advantage of hispresence on train No. 48, would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in carNo. 117, from eleven to twelve o'clock; and that he invited all whowere desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of thereligion of the "Latter Day Saints" to attend."I'll go," said Passepartout to himself.  He knew nothing of Mormonismexcept the custom of polygamy, which is its foundation.The news quickly spread through the train, which contained about onehundred passengers, thirty of whom, at most, attracted by the notice,ensconced themselves in car No. 117.  Passepartout took one of thefront seats.  Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend.At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an irritatedvoice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, "I tell you thatJoe Smith is a martyr, that his brother Hiram is a martyr, and that thepersecutions of the United States Government against the prophets willalso make a martyr of Brigham Young.  Who dares to say the contrary?"No one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tonecontrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage.  No doubt hisanger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actuallysubjected.  The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, inreducing these independent fanatics to its rule.  It had made itselfmaster of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union,after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy.The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, andresisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress.  Elder Hitch,as is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains.Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures,he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, inIsrael, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals ofthe new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, manycenturies later, a translation of this precious book, which was writtenin Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, whorevealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, thecelestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gavehim the annals of the Lord.Several of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary'snarrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his lecture,related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a fewdisciples, founded the church of the "Latter Day Saints," which,adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, andGermany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberalprofessions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, atemple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and atown built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, andreceived from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written byAbraham and several famous Egyptians.The Elder's story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience grewgradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers.  But thisdid not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with the story ofJoseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined creditors gavehim a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards,more honourable and honoured than ever, at Independence, Missouri, thechief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples, and hispursuit thence by outraged Gentiles, and retirement into the Far West.Ten hearers only were now left, among them honest Passepartout, who waslistening with all his ears.  Thus he learned that, after longpersecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded acommunity at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five thousandsouls, of which he became mayor, chief justice, and general-in-chief;that he announced himself, in 1843, as a candidate for the Presidencyof the United States; and that finally, being drawn into ambuscade atCarthage, he was thrown into prison, and assassinated by a band of mendisguised in masks.Passepartout was now the only person left in the car, and the Elder,looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years after theassassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, Brigham Young, hissuccessor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake, where, inthe midst of that fertile region, directly on the route of theemigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California, the new colony,thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons, had flourished beyondexpectations."And this," added Elder William Hitch, "this is why the jealousy ofCongress has been aroused against us!  Why have the soldiers of theUnion invaded the soil of Utah?  Why has Brigham Young, our chief, beenimprisoned, in contempt of all justice?  Shall we yield to force?Never!  Driven from Vermont, driven from Illinois, driven from Ohio,driven from Missouri, driven from Utah, we shall yet find someindependent territory on which to plant our tents.  And you, mybrother," continued the Elder, fixing his angry eyes upon his singleauditor, "will you not plant yours there, too, under the shadow of ourflag?""No!" replied Passepartout courageously, in his turn retiring from thecar, and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy.During the lecture the train had been making good progress, and towardshalf-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the Great SaltLake.  Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of thisinterior sea, which is also called the Dead Sea, and into which flowsan American Jordan.  It is a picturesque expanse, framed in lofty cragsin large strata, encrusted with white salt--a superb sheet of water,which was formerly of larger extent than now, its shores havingencroached with the lapse of time, and thus at once reduced its breadthand increased its depth.The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is situatedthree miles eight hundred feet above the sea.  Quite different fromLake Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea,it contains considerable salt, and one quarter of the weight of itswater is solid matter, its specific weight being 1,170, and, afterbeing distilled, 1,000.  Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it,and those which descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and otherstreams soon perish.The country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons aremostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals, fieldsof wheat, corn, and other cereals, luxuriant prairies, hedges of wildrose, clumps of acacias and milk-wort, would have been seen six monthslater.  Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow.The train reached Ogden at two o'clock, where it rested for six hours,Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City,connected with Ogden by a branch road; and they spent two hours in thisstrikingly American town, built on the pattern of other cities of theUnion, like a checker-board, "with the sombre sadness of right-angles,"as Victor Hugo expresses it.  The founder of the City of the Saintscould not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes theAnglo-Saxons.  In this strange country, where the people are certainlynot up to the level of their institutions, everything is done"squarely"--cities, houses, and follies.The travellers, then, were promenading, at three o'clock, about thestreets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and the spursof the Wahsatch Range.  They saw few or no churches, but the prophet'smansion, the court-house, and the arsenal, blue-brick houses withverandas and porches, surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias,palms, and locusts.  A clay and pebble wall, built in 1853, surroundedthe town; and in the principal street were the market and severalhotels adorned with pavilions.  The place did not seem thicklypopulated.  The streets were almost deserted, except in the vicinity ofthe temple, which they only reached after having traversed severalquarters surrounded by palisades.  There were many women, which waseasily accounted for by the "peculiar institution" of the Mormons; butit must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists.  They arefree to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it ismainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as,according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to thepossession of its highest joys.  These poor creatures seemed to beneither well off nor happy.  Some--the more well-to-do, no doubt--woreshort, open, black silk dresses, under a hood or modest shawl; otherswere habited in Indian fashion.Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women,charged, in groups, with conferring happiness on a single Mormon.  Hiscommon sense pitied, above all, the husband.  It seemed to him aterrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across thevicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it were, in a body to theMormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of theglorious Smith, who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightfulplace, to all eternity.  He felt decidedly repelled from such avocation, and he imagined--perhaps he was mistaken--that the fair onesof Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person.  Happily,his stay there was but brief.  At four the party found themselves againat the station, took their places in the train, and the whistle soundedfor starting.  Just at the moment, however, that the locomotive wheelsbegan to move, cries of "Stop! stop!" were heard.Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one.  The gentleman who utteredthe cries was evidently a belated Mormon.  He was breathless withrunning.  Happily for him, the station had neither gates nor barriers.He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform of the train,and fell, exhausted, into one of the seats.Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast,approached him with lively interest, and learned that he had takenflight after an unpleasant domestic scene.When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured to askhim politely how many wives he had; for, from the manner in which hehad decamped, it might be thought that he had twenty at least."One, sir," replied the Mormon, raising his arms heavenward--"one, andthat was enough!"Chapter XXVIIIIN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT DOES NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING ANYBODY LISTEN TOREASONThe train, on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden, passed northward for anhour as far as Weber River, having completed nearly nine hundred milesfrom San Francisco.  From this point it took an easterly directiontowards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains.  It was in the section includedbetween this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineersfound the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that thegovernment granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile,instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains.But the engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided itsdifficulties by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks.  Onetunnel only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order toarrive at the great basin.The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at theGreat Salt Lake.  From this point it described a long curve, descendingtowards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of thewaters between the Atlantic and the Pacific.  There were many creeks inthis mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek,Green Creek, and others, upon culverts.Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while Fixlonged to get out of this difficult region, and was more anxious thanPhileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents,and set foot on English soil.At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station, andtwenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory, following the valley ofBitter Creek throughout.  The next day, 7th December, they stopped fora quarter of an hour at Green River station.  Snow had fallenabundantly during the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had halfmelted, and did not interrupt their progress.  The bad weather,however, annoyed Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow, byblocking the wheels of the cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr.Fogg's tour."What an idea!" he said to himself.  "Why did my master make thisjourney in winter?  Couldn't he have waited for the good season toincrease his chances?"While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and thedepression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing fears from atotally different cause.Several passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking up anddown the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel StampProctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the SanFrancisco meeting.  Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drewback from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery.  She wasattached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences ofthe most absolute devotion.  She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depthof the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which shecalled gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, wasreally more than that.  Her heart sank within her when she recognisedthe man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account forhis conduct.  Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctoron this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards,that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary.Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix andPassepartout whom she had seen."That Proctor on this train!" cried Fix.  "Well, reassure yourself,madam; before he settles with Mr. Fogg; he has got to deal with me!  Itseems to me that I was the more insulted of the two.""And, besides," added Passepartout, "I'll take charge of him, colonelas he is.""Mr. Fix," resumed Aouda, "Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him.He said that he would come back to America to find this man.  Should heperceive Colonel Proctor, we could not prevent a collision which mighthave terrible results.  He must not see him.""You are right, madam," replied Fix; "a meeting between them might ruinall.  Whether he were victorious or beaten, Mr. Fogg would be delayed,and--""And," added Passepartout, "that would play the game of the gentlemenof the Reform Club.  In four days we shall be in New York.  Well, if mymaster does not leave this car during those four days, we may hope thatchance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American.We must, if possible, prevent his stirring out of it."The conversation dropped.  Mr. Fogg had just woke up, and was lookingout of the window.  Soon after Passepartout, without being heard by hismaster or Aouda, whispered to the detective, "Would you really fightfor him?""I would do anything," replied Fix, in a tone which betrayed determinedwill, "to get him back living to Europe!"Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, buthis confidence in his master remained unbroken.Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid ameeting between him and the colonel?  It ought not to be a difficulttask, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious.The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a fewmoments, he said to Mr. Fogg, "These are long and slow hours, sir, thatwe are passing on the railway.""Yes," replied Mr. Fogg; "but they pass.""You were in the habit of playing whist," resumed Fix, "on thesteamers.""Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here.  I have neither cardsnor partners.""Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all theAmerican trains.  And as for partners, if madam plays--""Certainly, sir," Aouda quickly replied; "I understand whist.  It ispart of an English education.""I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game.  Well, here arethree of us, and a dummy--""As you please, sir," replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume hisfavourite pastime even on the railway.Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returnedwith two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered withcloth.The game commenced.  Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and evenreceived some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg.  As for thedetective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched againsthis present opponent."Now," thought Passepartout, "we've got him.  He won't budge."At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge ofthe waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-fourfeet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained bythe track in crossing the Rocky Mountains.  After going about twohundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of thosevast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made sopropitious for laying the iron road.On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches ofthe North Platte River, already appeared.  The whole northern andeastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain whichis formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains, the highestbeing Laramie Peak.  Between this and the railway extended vast plains,plentifully irrigated.  On the right rose the lower spurs of themountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the ArkansasRiver, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri.At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of FortHalleck, which commands that section; and in a few more hours the RockyMountains were crossed.  There was reason to hope, then, that noaccident would mark the journey through this difficult country.  Thesnow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp and cold.  Largebirds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and flew off in the distance.No wild beast appeared on the plain.  It was a desert in its vastnakedness.After a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr. Fogg and hispartners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was heard,and the train stopped.  Passepartout put his head out of the door, butsaw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view.Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to getout; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant,"See what is the matter."Passepartout rushed out of the car.  Thirty or forty passengers hadalready descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor.The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way.  Theengineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man, whomthe station-master at Medicine Bow, the next stopping place, had senton before.  The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion,in which Colonel Proctor, with his insolent manner, was conspicuous.Passepartout, joining the group, heard the signal-man say, "No! youcan't pass.  The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would not bearthe weight of the train."This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a mile fromthe place where they now were.  According to the signal-man, it was ina ruinous condition, several of the iron wires being broken; and it wasimpossible to risk the passage.  He did not in any way exaggerate thecondition of the bridge.  It may be taken for granted that, rash as theAmericans usually are, when they are prudent there is good reason forit.Passepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard,listened with set teeth, immovable as a statue."Hum!" cried Colonel Proctor; "but we are not going to stay here, Iimagine, and take root in the snow?""Colonel," replied the conductor, "we have telegraphed to Omaha for atrain, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in lessthan six hours.""Six hours!" cried Passepartout."Certainly," returned the conductor, "besides, it will take us as longas that to reach Medicine Bow on foot.""But it is only a mile from here," said one of the passengers."Yes, but it's on the other side of the river.""And can't we cross that in a boat?" asked the colonel."That's impossible.  The creek is swelled by the rains.  It is a rapid,and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find aford."The colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway companyand the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was notdisinclined to make common cause with him.  Here was an obstacle,indeed, which all his master's banknotes could not remove.There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, withoutreckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen milesover a plain covered with snow.  They grumbled and protested, and wouldcertainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg's attention if he had notbeen completely absorbed in his game.Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what hadoccurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning towards the car, whenthe engineer, a true Yankee, named Forster called out, "Gentlemen,perhaps there is a way, after all, to get over.""On the bridge?" asked a passenger."On the bridge.""With our train?""With our train."Passepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer."But the bridge is unsafe," urged the conductor."No matter," replied Forster; "I think that by putting on the veryhighest speed we might have a chance of getting over.""The devil!" muttered Passepartout.But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer'sproposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found theplan a very feasible one.  He told stories about engineers leapingtheir trains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; andmany of those present avowed themselves of the engineer's mind."We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over," said one."Eighty! ninety!"Passepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything toget over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a little tooAmerican.  "Besides," thought he, "there's a still more simple way, andit does not even occur to any of these people!  Sir," said he aloud toone of the passengers, "the engineer's plan seems to me a littledangerous, but--""Eighty chances!" replied the passenger, turning his back on him."I know it," said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, "but asimple idea--""Ideas are no use," returned the American, shrugging his shoulders, "asthe engineer assures us that we can pass.""Doubtless," urged Passepartout, "we can pass, but perhaps it would bemore prudent--""What!  Prudent!" cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed toexcite prodigiously.  "At full speed, don't you see, at full speed!""I know--I see," repeated Passepartout; "but it would be, if not moreprudent, since that word displeases you, at least more natural--""Who!  What!  What's the matter with this fellow?" cried several.The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself."Are you afraid?" asked Colonel Proctor."I afraid?  Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can beas American as they!""All aboard!" cried the conductor."Yes, all aboard!" repeated Passepartout, and immediately.  "But theycan't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us tocross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!"But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone haveacknowledged its justice.  The passengers resumed their places in thecars.  Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed.  Thewhist-players were quite absorbed in their game.The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam,backed the train for nearly a mile--retiring, like a jumper, in orderto take a longer leap.  Then, with another whistle, he began to moveforward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity becamefrightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the pistonworked up and down twenty strokes to the second.  They perceived thatthe whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour,hardly bore upon the rails at all.And they passed over!  It was like a flash.  No one saw the bridge.The train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and theengineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond thestation.  But scarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge,completely ruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow.Chapter XXIXIN WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS ARE NARRATED WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE MET WITHON AMERICAN RAILROADSThe train pursued its course, that evening, without interruption,passing Fort Saunders, crossing Cheyne Pass, and reaching Evans Pass.The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey, eightthousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea.  Thetravellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains,levelled by nature.  A branch of the "grand trunk" led off southward toDenver, the capital of Colorado.  The country round about is rich ingold and silver, and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are alreadysettled there.Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from SanFrancisco, in three days and three nights; four days and nights morewould probably bring them to New York.  Phileas Fogg was not as yetbehind-hand.During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creekran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between theterritories of Wyoming and Colorado.  They entered Nebraska at eleven,passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the southern branchof the Platte River.It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rdof October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge.  Two powerfullocomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom wasThomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point;cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indianbattle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the RailwayPioneer was printed by a press brought on the train.  Thus wascelebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrumentof progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined tolink together cities and towns which do not yet exist.  The whistle ofthe locomotive, more powerful than Amphion's lyre, was about to bidthem rise from American soil.Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and threehundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reachingOmaha.  The road followed the capricious windings of the southernbranch of the Platte River, on its left bank.  At nine the trainstopped at the important town of North Platte, built between the twoarms of the river, which rejoin each other around it and form a singleartery, a large tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri alittle above Omaha.The one hundred and first meridian was passed.Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not even thedummy--complained of the length of the trip.  Fix had begun by winningseveral guineas, which he seemed likely to lose; but he showed himselfa not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg.  During the morning,chance distinctly favoured that gentleman.  Trumps and honours wereshowered upon his hands.Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of playinga spade, when a voice behind him said, "I should play a diamond."Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel Proctor.Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once."Ah! it's you, is it, Englishman?" cried the colonel; "it's you who aregoing to play a spade!""And who plays it," replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down the tenof spades."Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds," replied Colonel Proctor, inan insolent tone.He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played,adding, "You don't understand anything about whist.""Perhaps I do, as well as another," said Phileas Fogg, rising."You have only to try, son of John Bull," replied the colonel.Aouda turned pale, and her blood ran cold.  She seized Mr. Fogg's armand gently pulled him back.  Passepartout was ready to pounce upon theAmerican, who was staring insolently at his opponent.  But Fix got up,and, going to Colonel Proctor said, "You forget that it is I with whomyou have to deal, sir; for it was I whom you not only insulted, butstruck!""Mr. Fix," said Mr. Fogg, "pardon me, but this affair is mine, and mineonly.  The colonel has again insulted me, by insisting that I shouldnot play a spade, and he shall give me satisfaction for it.""When and where you will," replied the American, "and with whateverweapon you choose."Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg; as vainly did the detectiveendeavour to make the quarrel his.  Passepartout wished to throw thecolonel out of the window, but a sign from his master checked him.Phileas Fogg left the car, and the American followed him upon theplatform.  "Sir," said Mr. Fogg to his adversary, "I am in a greathurry to get back to Europe, and any delay whatever will be greatly tomy disadvantage.""Well, what's that to me?" replied Colonel Proctor."Sir," said Mr. Fogg, very politely, "after our meeting at SanFrancisco, I determined to return to America and find you as soon as Ihad completed the business which called me to England.""Really!""Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?""Why not ten years hence?""I say six months," returned Phileas Fogg; "and I shall be at the placeof meeting promptly.""All this is an evasion," cried Stamp Proctor.  "Now or never!""Very good.  You are going to New York?""No.""To Chicago?""No.""To Omaha?""What difference is it to you?  Do you know Plum Creek?""No," replied Mr. Fogg."It's the next station.  The train will be there in an hour, and willstop there ten minutes.  In ten minutes several revolver-shots could beexchanged.""Very well," said Mr. Fogg.  "I will stop at Plum Creek.""And I guess you'll stay there too," added the American insolently."Who knows?" replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as usual.He began to reassure Aouda, telling her that blusterers were never tobe feared, and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel, arequest which the detective could not refuse.  Mr. Fogg resumed theinterrupted game with perfect calmness.At eleven o'clock the locomotive's whistle announced that they wereapproaching Plum Creek station.  Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix,went out upon the platform.  Passepartout accompanied him, carrying apair of revolvers.  Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death.The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on theplatform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second.  Butjust as the combatants were about to step from the train, the conductorhurried up, and shouted, "You can't get off, gentlemen!""Why not?" asked the colonel."We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop.""But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman.""I am sorry," said the conductor; "but we shall be off at once.There's the bell ringing now."The train started."I'm really very sorry, gentlemen," said the conductor.  "Under anyother circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you.  But, afterall, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we goalong?""That wouldn't be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman," said thecolonel, in a jeering tone."It would be perfectly so," replied Phileas Fogg."Well, we are really in America," thought Passepartout, "and theconductor is a gentleman of the first order!"So muttering, he followed his master.The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed through thecars to the rear of the train.  The last car was only occupied by adozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked if they would notbe so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments, as two gentlemenhad an affair of honour to settle.  The passengers granted the requestwith alacrity, and straightway disappeared on the platform.The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for theirpurpose.  The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle, andfire at their ease.  Never was duel more easily arranged.  Mr. Fogg andColonel Proctor, each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers,entered the car.  The seconds, remaining outside, shut them in.  Theywere to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive.  After aninterval of two minutes, what remained of the two gentlemen would betaken from the car.Nothing could be more simple.  Indeed, it was all so simple that Fixand Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack.They were listening for the whistle agreed upon, when suddenly savagecries resounded in the air, accompanied by reports which certainly didnot issue from the car where the duellists were.  The reports continuedin front and the whole length of the train.  Cries of terror proceededfrom the interior of the cars.Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted theirprison, and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous.  Theythen perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux.This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for more thanonce they had waylaid trains on the road.  A hundred of them had,according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without stopping thetrain, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop.The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to whichthe passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by revolver-shots.The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the engineerand stoker with blows from their muskets.  A Sioux chief, wishing tostop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had openedwide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive wasplunging forward with terrific velocity.The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enragedmonkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand tohand with the passengers.  Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillagedit, throwing the trunks out of the train.  The cries and shots wereconstant.  The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the carswere barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carriedalong at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.Aouda behaved courageously from the first.  She defended herself like atrue heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windowswhenever a savage made his appearance.  Twenty Sioux had fallenmortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fellupon the rails as if they had been worms.  Several passengers, shot orstunned, lay on the seats.It was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted forten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if thetrain was not stopped.  Fort Kearney station, where there was agarrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Siouxwould be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the stationbeyond.The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell.At the same moment he cried, "Unless the train is stopped in fiveminutes, we are lost!""It shall be stopped," said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from thecar."Stay, monsieur," cried Passepartout; "I will go."Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a doorunperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the car; andwhile the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each otherover his head, he made use of his old acrobatic experience, and withamazing agility worked his way under the cars, holding on to thechains, aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes, creepingfrom one car to another with marvellous skill, and thus gaining theforward end of the train.There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender,with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing to thetraction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar,had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out.  The train, nowdetached from the engine, remained a little behind, whilst thelocomotive rushed forward with increased speed.Carried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved forseveral minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped,less than a hundred feet from Kearney station.The soldiers of the fort, attracted by the shots, hurried up; the Siouxhad not expected them, and decamped in a body before the train entirelystopped.But when the passengers counted each other on the station platformseveral were found missing; among others the courageous Frenchman,whose devotion had just saved them.Chapter XXXIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SIMPLY DOES HIS DUTYThree passengers including Passepartout had disappeared.  Had they beenkilled in the struggle?  Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux?  Itwas impossible to tell.There were many wounded, but none mortally.  Colonel Proctor was one ofthe most seriously hurt; he had fought bravely, and a ball had enteredhis groin.  He was carried into the station with the other woundedpassengers, to receive such attention as could be of avail.Aouda was safe; and Phileas Fogg, who had been in the thickest of thefight, had not received a scratch.  Fix was slightly wounded in thearm.  But Passepartout was not to be found, and tears coursed downAouda's cheeks.All the passengers had got out of the train, the wheels of which werestained with blood.  From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces offlesh.  As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind, redtrails were visible.  The last Sioux were disappearing in the south,along the banks of Republican River.Mr. Fogg, with folded arms, remained motionless.  He had a seriousdecision to make.  Aouda, standing near him, looked at him withoutspeaking, and he understood her look.  If his servant was a prisoner,ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians?  "Iwill find him, living or dead," said he quietly to Aouda."Ah, Mr.--Mr. Fogg!" cried she, clasping his hands and covering themwith tears."Living," added Mr. Fogg, "if we do not lose a moment."Phileas Fogg, by this resolution, inevitably sacrificed himself; hepronounced his own doom.  The delay of a single day would make him losethe steamer at New York, and his bet would be certainly lost.  But ashe thought, "It is my duty," he did not hesitate.The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there.  A hundred of hissoldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station,should the Sioux attack it."Sir," said Mr. Fogg to the captain, "three passengers havedisappeared.""Dead?" asked the captain."Dead or prisoners; that is the uncertainty which must be solved.  Doyou propose to pursue the Sioux?""That's a serious thing to do, sir," returned the captain.  "TheseIndians may retreat beyond the Arkansas, and I cannot leave the fortunprotected.""The lives of three men are in question, sir," said Phileas Fogg."Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three?""I don't know whether you can, sir; but you ought to do so.""Nobody here," returned the other, "has a right to teach me my duty.""Very well," said Mr. Fogg, coldly.  "I will go alone.""You, sir!" cried Fix, coming up; "you go alone in pursuit of theIndians?""Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish--him to whom everyone present owes his life?  I shall go.""No, sir, you shall not go alone," cried the captain, touched in spiteof himself.  "No! you are a brave man.  Thirty volunteers!" he added,turning to the soldiers.The whole company started forward at once.  The captain had only topick his men.  Thirty were chosen, and an old sergeant placed at theirhead."Thanks, captain," said Mr. Fogg."Will you let me go with you?" asked Fix."Do as you please, sir.  But if you wish to do me a favour, you willremain with Aouda.  In case anything should happen to me--"A sudden pallor overspread the detective's face.  Separate himself fromthe man whom he had so persistently followed step by step!  Leave himto wander about in this desert!  Fix gazed attentively at Mr. Fogg,and, despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going onwithin him, he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look."I will stay," said he.A few moments after, Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman's hand, and,having confided to her his precious carpet-bag, went off with thesergeant and his little squad.  But, before going, he had said to thesoldiers, "My friends, I will divide five thousand dollars among you,if we save the prisoners."It was then a little past noon.Aouda retired to a waiting-room, and there she waited alone, thinkingof the simple and noble generosity, the tranquil courage of PhileasFogg.  He had sacrificed his fortune, and was now risking his life, allwithout hesitation, from duty, in silence.Fix did not have the same thoughts, and could scarcely conceal hisagitation.  He walked feverishly up and down the platform, but soonresumed his outward composure.  He now saw the folly of which he hadbeen guilty in letting Fogg go alone.  What!  This man, whom he hadjust followed around the world, was permitted now to separate himselffrom him!  He began to accuse and abuse himself, and, as if he weredirector of police, administered to himself a sound lecture for hisgreenness."I have been an idiot!" he thought, "and this man will see it.  He hasgone, and won't come back!  But how is it that I, Fix, who have in mypocket a warrant for his arrest, have been so fascinated by him?Decidedly, I am nothing but an ass!"So reasoned the detective, while the hours crept by all too slowly.  Hedid not know what to do.  Sometimes he was tempted to tell Aouda all;but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive hisconfidences.  What course should he take?  He thought of pursuing Foggacross the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he mightovertake him.  Footsteps were easily printed on the snow!  But soon,under a new sheet, every imprint would be effaced.Fix became discouraged.  He felt a sort of insurmountable longing toabandon the game altogether.  He could now leave Fort Kearney station,and pursue his journey homeward in peace.Towards two o'clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing hard, longwhistles were heard approaching from the east.  A great shadow,preceded by a wild light, slowly advanced, appearing still largerthrough the mist, which gave it a fantastic aspect.  No train wasexpected from the east, neither had there been time for the succourasked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from Omaha to San Franciscowas not due till the next day.  The mystery was soon explained.The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles,was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued itsroute with such terrific rapidity, carrying off the unconsciousengineer and stoker.  It had run several miles, when, the fire becominglow for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; and it had finallystopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney.  Neitherthe engineer nor the stoker was dead, and, after remaining for sometime in their swoon, had come to themselves.  The train had thenstopped.  The engineer, when he found himself in the desert, and thelocomotive without cars, understood what had happened.  He could notimagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but hedid not doubt that the train left behind was in distress.He did not hesitate what to do.  It would be prudent to continue on toOmaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, which theIndians might still be engaged in pillaging.  Nevertheless, he began torebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted, and thelocomotive returned, running backwards to Fort Kearney.  This it waswhich was whistling in the mist.The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at thehead of the train.  They could now continue the journey so terriblyinterrupted.Aouda, on seeing the locomotive come up, hurried out of the station,and asked the conductor, "Are you going to start?""At once, madam.""But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travellers--""I cannot interrupt the trip," replied the conductor.  "We are alreadythree hours behind time.""And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?""To-morrow evening, madam.""To-morrow evening!  But then it will be too late!  We must wait--""It is impossible," responded the conductor.  "If you wish to go,please get in.""I will not go," said Aouda.Fix had heard this conversation.  A little while before, when there wasno prospect of proceeding on the journey, he had made up his mind toleave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was there, ready to start,and he had only to take his seat in the car, an irresistible influenceheld him back.  The station platform burned his feet, and he could notstir.  The conflict in his mind again began; anger and failure stifledhim.  He wished to struggle on to the end.Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded, among them ColonelProctor, whose injuries were serious, had taken their places in thetrain.  The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard, and the steamwas escaping from the valves.  The engineer whistled, the trainstarted, and soon disappeared, mingling its white smoke with the eddiesof the densely falling snow.The detective had remained behind.Several hours passed.  The weather was dismal, and it was very cold.Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have beenthought asleep.  Aouda, despite the storm, kept coming out of thewaiting-room, going to the end of the platform, and peering through thetempest of snow, as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizonaround her, and to hear, if possible, some welcome sound.  She heardand saw nothing.  Then she would return, chilled through, to issue outagain after the lapse of a few moments, but always in vain.Evening came, and the little band had not returned.  Where could theybe?  Had they found the Indians, and were they having a conflict withthem, or were they still wandering amid the mist?  The commander of thefort was anxious, though he tried to conceal his apprehensions.  Asnight approached, the snow fell less plentifully, but it becameintensely cold.  Absolute silence rested on the plains.  Neither flightof bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm.Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart stifledwith anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains.  Herimagination carried her far off, and showed her innumerable dangers.What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible todescribe.Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep.  Once aman approached and spoke to him, and the detective merely replied byshaking his head.Thus the night passed.  At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the sunrose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recogniseobjects two miles off.  Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward;in the south all was still vacancy.  It was then seven o'clock.The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to take.Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?  Shouldhe sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those alreadysacrificed?  His hesitation did not last long, however.  Calling one ofhis lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance, whengunshots were heard.  Was it a signal?  The soldiers rushed out of thefort, and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning ingood order.Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him werePassepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the Sioux.They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney.Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and his companionshad begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the Frenchmanhad felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened upto their relief.All were welcomed with joyful cries.  Phileas Fogg distributed thereward he had promised to the soldiers, while Passepartout, not withoutreason, muttered to himself, "It must certainly be confessed that Icost my master dear!"Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have beendifficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him.  As forAouda, she took her protector's hand and pressed it in her own, toomuch moved to speak.Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought heshould find it there, ready to start for Omaha, and he hoped that thetime lost might be regained."The train! the train!" cried he."Gone," replied Fix."And when does the next train pass here?" said Phileas Fogg."Not till this evening.""Ah!" returned the impassible gentleman quietly.Chapter XXXIIN WHICH FIX, THE DETECTIVE, CONSIDERABLY FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OFPHILEAS FOGGPhileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time.  Passepartout, theinvoluntary cause of this delay, was desperate.  He had ruined hismaster!At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking himintently in the face, said:"Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?""Quite seriously.""I have a purpose in asking," resumed Fix.  "Is it absolutely necessarythat you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine o'clock in theevening, the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool?""It is absolutely necessary.""And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians, youwould have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?""Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left.""Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind.  Twelve from twentyleaves eight.  You must regain eight hours.  Do you wish to try to doso?""On foot?" asked Mr. Fogg."No; on a sledge," replied Fix.  "On a sledge with sails.  A man hasproposed such a method to me."It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offerhe had refused.Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out theman, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg wentup to him.  An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name wasMudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two longbeams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and uponwhich there was room for five or six persons.  A high mast was fixed onthe frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached alarge brigantine sail.  This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoista jib-sail.  Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle.  Itwas, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop.  During the winter, whenthe trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremelyrapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another.Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them,they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if notsuperior to that of the express trains.Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft.  Thewind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west.  The snowhad hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transportMr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha.  Thence the trains eastward runfrequently to Chicago and New York.  It was not impossible that thelost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to berejected.Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in theopen air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at FortKearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by abetter route and under more favourable conditions.  But Aouda refusedto separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with herdecision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fixwas with him.It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts.  Was thisconviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still regard himas an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the worldcompleted, would think himself absolutely safe in England?  PerhapsFix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he wasnevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the return of thewhole party to England as much as possible.At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start.  The passengers tooktheir places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in theirtravelling-cloaks.  The two great sails were hoisted, and under thepressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with avelocity of forty miles an hour.The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is atmost two hundred miles.  If the wind held good, the distance might betraversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reachOmaha by one o'clock.What a journey!  The travellers, huddled close together, could notspeak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they weregoing.  The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves.  Whenthe breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted offthe ground by its sails.  Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in astraight line, and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which thevehicle had a tendency to make.  All the sails were up, and the jib wasso arranged as not to screen the brigantine.  A top-mast was hoisted,and another jib, held out to the wind, added its force to the othersails.  Although the speed could not be exactly estimated, the sledgecould not be going at less than forty miles an hour."If nothing breaks," said Mudge, "we shall get there!"Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge's interest to reach Omaha within thetime agreed on, by the offer of a handsome reward.The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, wasas flat as a sea.  It seemed like a vast frozen lake.  The railroadwhich ran through this section ascended from the south-west to thenorth-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town,Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha.  It followed throughout the right bankof the Platte River.  The sledge, shortening this route, took a chordof the arc described by the railway.  Mudge was not afraid of beingstopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen.  The road, then,was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things tofear--an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend themast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly.  Theselashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as ifvibrated by a violin bow.  The sledge slid along in the midst of aplaintively intense melody."Those chords give the fifth and the octave," said Mr. Fogg.These were the only words he uttered during the journey.  Aouda, cosilypacked in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from theattacks of the freezing wind.  As for Passepartout, his face was as redas the sun's disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaledthe biting air.  With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hopeagain.  They would reach New York on the evening, if not on themorning, of the 11th, and there was still some chances that it would bebefore the steamer sailed for Liverpool.Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by thehand.  He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge,the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by somepresentiment, he kept his usual reserve.  One thing, however,Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr.Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux.  Mr.Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No!  His servant would neverforget that!While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, thesledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow.  The creeks it passedover were not perceived.  Fields and streams disappeared under theuniform whiteness.  The plain was absolutely deserted.  Between theUnion Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with SaintJoseph it formed a great uninhabited island.  Neither village, station,nor fort appeared.  From time to time they sped by some phantom-liketree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind.  Sometimesflocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferociousprairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge.  Passepartout, revolver inhand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near.  Had anaccident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by thesebeasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on itseven course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howlingband at a safe distance behind.About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossingthe Platte River.  He said nothing, but he felt certain that he was nowwithin twenty miles of Omaha.  In less than an hour he left the rudderand furled his sails, whilst the sledge, carried forward by the greatimpetus the wind had given it, went on half a mile further with itssails unspread.It stopped at last, and Mudge, pointing to a mass of roofs white withsnow, said: "We have got there!"Arrived!  Arrived at the station which is in daily communication, bynumerous trains, with the Atlantic seaboard!Passepartout and Fix jumped off, stretched their stiffened limbs, andaided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge.  PhileasFogg generously rewarded Mudge, whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped,and the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station.The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this importantNebraska town.  Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and RockIsland Railroad, which runs directly east, and passes fifty stations.A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached thestation, and they only had time to get into the cars.  They had seennothing of Omaha; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this wasnot to be regretted, as they were not travelling to see the sights.The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa, by Council Bluffs,Des Moines, and Iowa City.  During the night it crossed the Mississippiat Davenport, and by Rock Island entered Illinois.  The next day, whichwas the 10th, at four o'clock in the evening, it reached Chicago,already risen from its ruins, and more proudly seated than ever on theborders of its beautiful Lake Michigan.Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York; but trains are notwanting at Chicago.  Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other, andthe locomotive of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railway leftat full speed, as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had notime to lose.  It traversed Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jerseylike a flash, rushing through towns with antique names, some of whichhad streets and car-tracks, but as yet no houses.  At last the Hudsoncame into view; and, at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the11th, the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river,before the very pier of the Cunard line.The China, for Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an hour before!Chapter XXXIIIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ENGAGES IN A DIRECT STRUGGLE WITH BAD FORTUNEThe China, in leaving, seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg's lasthope.  None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects.  ThePereire, of the French Transatlantic Company, whose admirable steamersare equal to any in speed and comfort, did not leave until the 14th;the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London, but toHavre; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would renderPhileas Fogg's last efforts of no avail.  The Inman steamer did notdepart till the next day, and could not cross the Atlantic in time tosave the wager.Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw, which gave himthe daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers.Passepartout was crushed; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat bythree-quarters of an hour.  It was his fault, for, instead of helpinghis master, he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path!  And whenhe recalled all the incidents of the tour, when he counted up the sumsexpended in pure loss and on his own account, when he thought that theimmense stake, added to the heavy charges of this useless journey,would completely ruin Mr. Fogg, he overwhelmed himself with bitterself-accusations.  Mr. Fogg, however, did not reproach him; and, onleaving the Cunard pier, only said: "We will consult about what is bestto-morrow.  Come."The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat, and drove ina carriage to the St. Nicholas Hotel, on Broadway.  Rooms were engaged,and the night passed, briefly to Phileas Fogg, who slept profoundly,but very long to Aouda and the others, whose agitation did not permitthem to rest.The next day was the 12th of December.  From seven in the morning ofthe 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there werenine days, thirteen hours, and forty-five minutes.  If Phileas Fogg hadleft in the China, one of the fastest steamers on the Atlantic, hewould have reached Liverpool, and then London, within the period agreedupon.Mr. Fogg left the hotel alone, after giving Passepartout instructionsto await his return, and inform Aouda to be ready at an instant'snotice.  He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson, and looked aboutamong the vessels moored or anchored in the river, for any that wereabout to depart.  Several had departure signals, and were preparing toput to sea at morning tide; for in this immense and admirable portthere is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for everyquarter of the globe.  But they were mostly sailing vessels, of which,of course, Phileas Fogg could make no use.He seemed about to give up all hope, when he espied, anchored at theBattery, a cable's length off at most, a trading vessel, with a screw,well-shaped, whose funnel, puffing a cloud of smoke, indicated that shewas getting ready for departure.Phileas Fogg hailed a boat, got into it, and soon found himself onboard the Henrietta, iron-hulled, wood-built above.  He ascended to thedeck, and asked for the captain, who forthwith presented himself.  Hewas a man of fifty, a sort of sea-wolf, with big eyes, a complexion ofoxidised copper, red hair and thick neck, and a growling voice."The captain?" asked Mr. Fogg."I am the captain.""I am Phileas Fogg, of London.""And I am Andrew Speedy, of Cardiff.""You are going to put to sea?""In an hour.""You are bound for--""Bordeaux.""And your cargo?""No freight.  Going in ballast.""Have you any passengers?""No passengers.  Never have passengers.  Too much in the way.""Is your vessel a swift one?""Between eleven and twelve knots.  The Henrietta, well known.""Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool?""To Liverpool?  Why not to China?""I said Liverpool.""No!""No?""No.  I am setting out for Bordeaux, and shall go to Bordeaux.""Money is no object?""None."The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply."But the owners of the Henrietta--" resumed Phileas Fogg."The owners are myself," replied the captain.  "The vessel belongs tome.""I will freight it for you.""No.""I will buy it of you.""No."Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment; but the situationwas a grave one.  It was not at New York as at Hong Kong, nor with thecaptain of the Henrietta as with the captain of the Tankadere.  Up tothis time money had smoothed away every obstacle.  Now money failed.Still, some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat, unlessby balloon--which would have been venturesome, besides not beingcapable of being put in practice.  It seemed that Phileas Fogg had anidea, for he said to the captain, "Well, will you carry me to Bordeaux?""No, not if you paid me two hundred dollars.""I offer you two thousand.""Apiece?""Apiece.""And there are four of you?""Four."Captain Speedy began to scratch his head.  There were eight thousanddollars to gain, without changing his route; for which it was wellworth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers.Besides, passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers,but valuable merchandise.  "I start at nine o'clock," said CaptainSpeedy, simply.  "Are you and your party ready?""We will be on board at nine o'clock," replied, no less simply, Mr.Fogg.It was half-past eight.  To disembark from the Henrietta, jump into ahack, hurry to the St. Nicholas, and return with Aouda, Passepartout,and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time, and wasperformed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him.They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor.When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost, heuttered a prolonged "Oh!" which extended throughout his vocal gamut.As for Fix, he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainlynot come out of this affair well indemnified.  When they reachedEngland, even if Mr. Fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank-billsinto the sea, more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent!Chapter XXXIIIIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASIONAn hour after, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks theentrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea.During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, anddirected her course rapidly eastward.At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain thevessel's position.  It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy.Not the least in the world.  It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.  As forCaptain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and wasuttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable andexcessive.What had happened was very simple.  Phileas Fogg wished to go toLiverpool, but the captain would not carry him there.  Then PhileasFogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours hehad been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that thesailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not onthe best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body.  This waswhy Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why thecaptain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henriettawas directing her course towards Liverpool.  It was very clear, to seeMr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.How the adventure ended will be seen anon.  Aouda was anxious, thoughshe said nothing.  As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg's manoeuvresimply glorious.  The captain had said "between eleven and twelveknots," and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction.If, then--for there were "ifs" still--the sea did not become tooboisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accidenthappened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross thethree thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days,between the 12th and the 21st of December.  It is true that, oncearrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bankof England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than heimagined or could desire.During the first days, they went along smoothly enough.  The sea wasnot very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east,the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waveslike a real trans-Atlantic steamer.Passepartout was delighted.  His master's last exploit, theconsequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.  Never had the crewseen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.  He formed warm friendships withthe sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.  He thought theymanaged the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up likeheroes.  His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.  He hadforgotten the past, its vexations and delays.  He only thought of theend, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over withimpatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.  Often,also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with akeen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their oldintimacy no longer existed.Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on.The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managingthe boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.  He did notknow what to think.  For, after all, a man who began by stealingfifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix wasnot unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg'scommand, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of theworld where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himselfin safety.  The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and thedetective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; andPassepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous ashe was, took the greatest precautions.  Mr. Fogg did not seem even toknow that there was a captain on board.On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, adangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequentfogs and heavy gales of wind.  Ever since the evening before thebarometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in theatmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the coldbecame sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east.This was a misfortune.  Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from hiscourse, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but thevessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long wavesof which broke against the stern.  She pitched violently, and thisretarded her progress.  The breeze little by little swelled into atempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be ableto maintain herself upright on the waves.Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days thepoor fellow experienced constant fright.  But Phileas Fogg was a boldmariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kepton his course, without even decreasing his steam.  The Henrietta, whenshe could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, butpassing safely.  Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating itsprotruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above thewaves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have beenfeared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on witha speed of ninety miles an hour.  It continued fresh, but, unhappily,it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless.The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg'sdeparture from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriouslydelayed.  Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worstlocalities had been passed.  In summer, success would have beenwell-nigh certain.  In winter, they were at the mercy of the badseason.  Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret,and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failedthem, they might still count on the steam.On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and beganto speak earnestly with him.  Without knowing why it was apresentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy.  He wouldhave given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer wassaying.  He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heardhis master say, "You are certain of what you tell me?""Certain, sir," replied the engineer.  "You must remember that, sincewe started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, thoughwe had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, wehaven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool." "Iwill consider," replied Mr. Fogg.Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety.  Thecoal was giving out!  "Ah, if my master can get over that," mutteredhe, "he'll be a famous man!"  He could not help imparting to Fix whathe had overheard."Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?""Of course.""Ass!" replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning onhis heel.Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, thereason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but hereflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointedand humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed afalse scent around the world, and refrained.And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt?  It was difficult toimagine.  Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for thatevening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, "Feed all the firesuntil the coal is exhausted."A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrentsof smoke.  The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but onthe 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coalwould give out in the course of the day."Do not let the fires go down," replied Mr. Fogg.  "Keep them up to thelast.  Let the valves be filled."Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, calledPassepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.  It was as ifthe honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.  He went tothe poop, saying to himself, "He will be like a madman!"In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on thepoop-deck.  The bomb was Captain Speedy.  It was clear that he was onthe point of bursting.  "Where are we?"  were the first words his angerpermitted him to utter.  Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he couldnever have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath."Where are we?" he repeated, with purple face."Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool," replied Mr. Fogg, withimperturbable calmness."Pirate!" cried Captain Speedy."I have sent for you, sir--""Pickaroon!""--sir," continued Mr. Fogg, "to ask you to sell me your vessel.""No!  By all the devils, no!""But I shall be obliged to burn her.""Burn the Henrietta!""Yes; at least the upper part of her.  The coal has given out.""Burn my vessel!" cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronouncethe words.  "A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!""Here are sixty thousand," replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain aroll of bank-bills.  This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy.  AnAmerican can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousanddollars.  The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment,and all his grudges against his passenger.  The Henrietta was twentyyears old; it was a great bargain.  The bomb would not go off afterall.  Mr. Fogg had taken away the match."And I shall still have the iron hull," said the captain in a softertone."The iron hull and the engine.  Is it agreed?""Agreed."And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consignedthem to his pocket.During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fixseemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit.  Nearly twentythousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine tothe captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft!  It was true,however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank.When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, "Don'tlet this astonish you, sir.  You must know that I shall lose twentythousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine onthe evening of the 21st of December.  I missed the steamer at New York,and as you refused to take me to Liverpool--""And I did well!" cried Andrew Speedy; "for I have gained at leastforty thousand dollars by it!"  He added, more sedately, "Do you knowone thing, Captain--""Fogg.""Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you."And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment, hewas going away, when Mr. Fogg said, "The vessel now belongs to me?""Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the masts--all the wood, thatis.""Very well.  Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled down,and burn them."It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequatepressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deckwere sacrificed.  On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts,rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up thefires.  Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might.There was a perfect rage for demolition.The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sidesdisappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk.But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light.  By tenin the evening they were passing Queenstown.  Phileas Fogg had onlytwenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of timewas necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on.  And the steam wasabout to give out altogether!"Sir," said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg'sproject, "I really commiserate you.  Everything is against you.  We areonly opposite Queenstown.""Ah," said Mr. Fogg, "is that place where we see the lights Queenstown?""Yes.""Can we enter the harbour?""Not under three hours.  Only at high tide.""Stay," replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his features thatby a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquerill-fortune.Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stopto put off the mails.  These mails are carried to Dublin by expresstrains always held in readiness to start; from Dublin they are sent onto Liverpool by the most rapid boats, and thus gain twelve hours on theAtlantic steamers.Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way.  Insteadof arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta, he would bethere by noon, and would therefore have time to reach London before aquarter before nine in the evening.The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning,it then being high tide; and Phileas Fogg, after being grasped heartilyby the hand by Captain Speedy, left that gentleman on the levelled hulkof his craft, which was still worth half what he had sold it for.The party went on shore at once.  Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr.Fogg on the spot; but he did not.  Why?  What struggle was going onwithin him?  Had he changed his mind about "his man"?  Did heunderstand that he had made a grave mistake?  He did not, however,abandon Mr. Fogg.  They all got upon the train, which was just ready tostart, at half-past one; at dawn of day they were in Dublin; and theylost no time in embarking on a steamer which, disdaining to rise uponthe waves, invariably cut through them.Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay, at twentyminutes before twelve, 21st December.  He was only six hours distantfrom London.But at this moment Fix came up, put his hand upon Mr. Fogg's shoulder,and, showing his warrant, said, "You are really Phileas Fogg?""I am.""I arrest you in the Queen's name!"Chapter XXXIVIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AT LAST REACHES LONDONPhileas Fogg was in prison.  He had been shut up in the Custom House,and he was to be transferred to London the next day.Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen uponFix had he not been held back by some policemen.  Aouda wasthunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could notunderstand.  Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honestand courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber.  The young woman's heartrevolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she couldattempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly.As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, whetherMr. Fogg were guilty or not.The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this newmisfortune!  Had he not concealed Fix's errand from his master?  WhenFix revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr.Fogg?  If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fixproof of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fixwould not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels ofhis master, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil.Passepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brainsout.Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of theCustom House.  Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious tosee Mr. Fogg again.That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he wasabout to attain his end.  This arrest was fatal.  Having arrived atLiverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, hehad till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club,that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to Londonwas six hours.If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would havefound Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger,upon a wooden bench.  He was not, it is true, resigned; but this lastblow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion.  Washe being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terriblebecause contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistibleforce, at the last moment?  No one could tell.  There he sat, calmlywaiting--for what?  Did he still cherish hope?  Did he still believe,now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he wouldsucceed?However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon thetable, and observed its advancing hands.  Not a word escaped his lips,but his look was singularly set and stern.  The situation, in anyevent, was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Foggwas honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught.Did escape occur to him?  Did he examine to see if there were anypracticable outlet from his prison?  Did he think of escaping from it?Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room.  But the door waslocked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods.  He sat downagain, and drew his journal from his pocket.  On the line where thesewords were written, "21st December, Saturday, Liverpool," he added,"80th day, 11.40 a.m.," and waited.The Custom House clock struck one.  Mr. Fogg observed that his watchwas two hours too fast.Two hours!  Admitting that he was at this moment taking an expresstrain, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter beforenine, p.m.  His forehead slightly wrinkled.At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside,then a hasty opening of doors.  Passepartout's voice was audible, andimmediately after that of Fix.  Phileas Fogg's eyes brightened for aninstant.The door swung open, and he saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, whohurried towards him.Fix was out of breath, and his hair was in disorder.  He could notspeak.  "Sir," he stammered, "sir--forgive me--most--unfortunateresemblance--robber arrested three days ago--you are free!"Phileas Fogg was free!  He walked to the detective, looked him steadilyin the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in hislife, or which he ever would make, drew back his arms, and with theprecision of a machine knocked Fix down."Well hit!" cried Passepartout, "Parbleu! that's what you might call agood application of English fists!"Fix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word.  He had onlyreceived his deserts.  Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout left theCustom House without delay, got into a cab, and in a few momentsdescended at the station.Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave forLondon.  It was forty minutes past two.  The express train had leftthirty-five minutes before.  Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train.There were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railwayarrangements did not permit the special train to leave until threeo'clock.At that hour Phileas Fogg, having stimulated the engineer by the offerof a generous reward, at last set out towards London with Aouda and hisfaithful servant.It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half; and thiswould have been easy on a clear road throughout.  But there were forceddelays, and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus, allthe clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine.Having made the tour of the world, he was behind-hand five minutes.  Hehad lost the wager!Chapter XXXVIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DOES NOT HAVE TO REPEAT HIS ORDERS TOPASSEPARTOUT TWICEThe dwellers in Saville Row would have been surprised the next day, ifthey had been told that Phileas Fogg had returned home.  His doors andwindows were still closed, no appearance of change was visible.After leaving the station, Mr. Fogg gave Passepartout instructions topurchase some provisions, and quietly went to his domicile.He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity.  Ruined!  And bythe blundering of the detective!  After having steadily traversed thatlong journey, overcome a hundred obstacles, braved many dangers, andstill found time to do some good on his way, to fail near the goal by asudden event which he could not have foreseen, and against which he wasunarmed; it was terrible!  But a few pounds were left of the large sumhe had carried with him.  There only remained of his fortune the twentythousand pounds deposited at Barings, and this amount he owed to hisfriends of the Reform Club.  So great had been the expense of his tourthat, even had he won, it would not have enriched him; and it isprobable that he had not sought to enrich himself, being a man whorather laid wagers for honour's sake than for the stake proposed.  Butthis wager totally ruined him.Mr. Fogg's course, however, was fully decided upon; he knew whatremained for him to do.A room in the house in Saville Row was set apart for Aouda, who wasoverwhelmed with grief at her protector's misfortune.  From the wordswhich Mr. Fogg dropped, she saw that he was meditating some seriousproject.Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort tothe desperate expedient of suicide, Passepartout kept a narrow watchupon his master, though he carefully concealed the appearance of sodoing.First of all, the worthy fellow had gone up to his room, and hadextinguished the gas burner, which had been burning for eighty days.He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company, and hethought it more than time to put a stop to this expense, which he hadbeen doomed to bear.The night passed.  Mr. Fogg went to bed, but did he sleep?  Aouda didnot once close her eyes.  Passepartout watched all night, like afaithful dog, at his master's door.Mr. Fogg called him in the morning, and told him to get Aouda'sbreakfast, and a cup of tea and a chop for himself.  He desired Aoudato excuse him from breakfast and dinner, as his time would be absorbedall day in putting his affairs to rights.  In the evening he would askpermission to have a few moment's conversation with the young lady.Passepartout, having received his orders, had nothing to do but obeythem.  He looked at his imperturbable master, and could scarcely bringhis mind to leave him.  His heart was full, and his conscience torturedby remorse; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being thecause of the irretrievable disaster.  Yes! if he had warned Mr. Fogg,and had betrayed Fix's projects to him, his master would certainly nothave given the detective passage to Liverpool, and then--Passepartout could hold in no longer."My master!  Mr. Fogg!" he cried, "why do you not curse me?  It was myfault that--""I blame no one," returned Phileas Fogg, with perfect calmness.  "Go!"Passepartout left the room, and went to find Aouda, to whom hedelivered his master's message."Madam," he added, "I can do nothing myself--nothing!  I have noinfluence over my master; but you, perhaps--""What influence could I have?" replied Aouda.  "Mr. Fogg is influencedby no one.  Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him isoverflowing?  Has he ever read my heart?  My friend, he must not beleft alone an instant!  You say he is going to speak with me thisevening?""Yes, madam; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort inEngland.""We shall see," replied Aouda, becoming suddenly pensive.Throughout this day (Sunday) the house in Saville Row was as ifuninhabited, and Phileas Fogg, for the first time since he had lived inthat house, did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struckhalf-past eleven.Why should he present himself at the Reform?  His friends no longerexpected him there.  As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon onthe evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter beforenine), he had lost his wager.  It was not even necessary that he shouldgo to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonistsalready had his cheque in their hands, and they had only to fill it outand send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to theircredit.Mr. Fogg, therefore, had no reason for going out, and so he remained athome.  He shut himself up in his room, and busied himself putting hisaffairs in order.  Passepartout continually ascended and descended thestairs.  The hours were long for him. He listened at his master's door,and looked through the keyhole, as if he had a perfect right so to do,and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment.Sometimes he thought of Fix, but no longer in anger.  Fix, like all theworld, had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty intracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout. . . .  This thoughthaunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.Finding himself too wretched to remain alone, he knocked at Aouda'sdoor, went into her room, seated himself, without speaking, in acorner, and looked ruefully at the young woman. Aouda was still pensive.About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if Aoudawould receive him, and in a few moments he found himself alone with her.Phileas Fogg took a chair, and sat down near the fireplace, oppositeAouda.  No emotion was visible on his face.  Fogg returned was exactlythe Fogg who had gone away; there was the same calm, the sameimpassibility.He sat several minutes without speaking; then, bending his eyes onAouda, "Madam," said he, "will you pardon me for bringing you toEngland?""I, Mr. Fogg!" replied Aouda, checking the pulsations of her heart."Please let me finish," returned Mr. Fogg.  "When I decided to bringyou far away from the country which was so unsafe for you, I was rich,and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; thenyour existence would have been free and happy.  But now I am ruined.""I know it, Mr. Fogg," replied Aouda; "and I ask you in my turn, willyou forgive me for having followed you, and--who knows?--for having,perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your ruin?""Madam, you could not remain in India, and your safety could only beassured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors couldnot take you.""So, Mr. Fogg," resumed Aouda, "not content with rescuing me from aterrible death, you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in aforeign land?""Yes, madam; but circumstances have been against me.  Still, I beg toplace the little I have left at your service.""But what will become of you, Mr. Fogg?""As for me, madam," replied the gentleman, coldly, "I have need ofnothing.""But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?""As I am in the habit of doing.""At least," said Aouda, "want should not overtake a man like you.  Yourfriends--""I have no friends, madam.""Your relatives--""I have no longer any relatives.""I pity you, then, Mr. Fogg, for solitude is a sad thing, with no heartto which to confide your griefs.  They say, though, that misery itself,shared by two sympathetic souls, may be borne with patience.""They say so, madam.""Mr. Fogg," said Aouda, rising and seizing his hand, "do you wish atonce a kinswoman and friend?  Will you have me for your wife?"Mr. Fogg, at this, rose in his turn.  There was an unwonted light inhis eyes, and a slight trembling of his lips.  Aouda looked into hisface.  The sincerity, rectitude, firmness, and sweetness of this softglance of a noble woman, who could dare all to save him to whom sheowed all, at first astonished, then penetrated him.  He shut his eyesfor an instant, as if to avoid her look.  When he opened them again, "Ilove you!" he said, simply.  "Yes, by all that is holiest, I love you,and I am entirely yours!""Ah!" cried Aouda, pressing his hand to her heart.Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately.  Mr. Fogg stillheld Aouda's hand in his own; Passepartout understood, and his big,round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith.Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend SamuelWilson, of Marylebone parish, that evening.Passepartout smiled his most genial smile, and said, "Never too late."It was five minutes past eight."Will it be for to-morrow, Monday?""For to-morrow, Monday," said Mr. Fogg, turning to Aouda."Yes; for to-morrow, Monday," she replied.Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him.Chapter XXXVIIN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG'S NAME IS ONCE MORE AT A PREMIUM ON 'CHANGEIt is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinionwhen it transpired that the real bankrobber, a certain James Strand,had been arrested, on the 17th day of December, at Edinburgh.  Threedays before, Phileas Fogg had been a criminal, who was beingdesperately followed up by the police; now he was an honourablegentleman, mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round theworld.The papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those who hadlaid bets, for or against him, revived their interest, as if by magic;the "Phileas Fogg bonds" again became negotiable, and many new wagerswere made.  Phileas Fogg's name was once more at a premium on 'Change.His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a stateof feverish suspense.  Would Phileas Fogg, whom they had forgotten,reappear before their eyes!  Where was he at this moment?  The 17th ofDecember, the day of James Strand's arrest, was the seventy-sixth sincePhileas Fogg's departure, and no news of him had been received.  Was hedead?  Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journeyalong the route agreed upon?  And would he appear on Saturday, the 21stof December, at a quarter before nine in the evening, on the thresholdof the Reform Club saloon?The anxiety in which, for three days, London society existed, cannot bedescribed.  Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of PhileasFogg.  Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morningand evening.  No news.  The police were ignorant what had become of thedetective, Fix, who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent.Bets increased, nevertheless, in number and value.  Phileas Fogg, likea racehorse, was drawing near his last turning-point.  The bonds werequoted, no longer at a hundred below par, but at twenty, at ten, and atfive; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour.A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streetson Saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanentlyestablished around the Reform Club.  Circulation was impeded, andeverywhere disputes, discussions, and financial transactions were goingon.  The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd, and asthe hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached, the excitement rose toits highest pitch.The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of theclub.  John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, the bankers, Andrew Stuart,the engineer, Gauthier Ralph, the director of the Bank of England, andThomas Flanagan, the brewer, one and all waited anxiously.When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight, Andrew Stuart gotup, saying, "Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the time agreed upon betweenMr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired.""What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?"  asked ThomasFlanagan."At twenty-three minutes past seven," replied Gauthier Ralph; "and thenext does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve.""Well, gentlemen," resumed Andrew Stuart, "if Phileas Fogg had come inthe 7:23 train, he would have got here by this time.  We can,therefore, regard the bet as won.""Wait; don't let us be too hasty," replied Samuel Fallentin.  "You knowthat Mr. Fogg is very eccentric.  His punctuality is well known; henever arrives too soon, or too late; and I should not be surprised ifhe appeared before us at the last minute.""Why," said Andrew Stuart nervously, "if I should see him, I should notbelieve it was he.""The fact is," resumed Thomas Flanagan, "Mr. Fogg's project wasabsurdly foolish.  Whatever his punctuality, he could not prevent thedelays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two or threedays would be fatal to his tour.""Observe, too," added John Sullivan, "that we have received nointelligence from him, though there are telegraphic lines all along hisroute.""He has lost, gentleman," said Andrew Stuart, "he has a hundred timeslost!  You know, besides, that the China the only steamer he could havetaken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday.  I have seena list of the passengers, and the name of Phileas Fogg is not amongthem.  Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him, he can scarcelyhave reached America.  I think he will be at least twenty daysbehind-hand, and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand.""It is clear," replied Gauthier Ralph; "and we have nothing to do butto present Mr. Fogg's cheque at Barings to-morrow."At this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutesto nine."Five minutes more," said Andrew Stuart.The five gentlemen looked at each other.  Their anxiety was becomingintense; but, not wishing to betray it, they readily assented to Mr.Fallentin's proposal of a rubber."I wouldn't give up my four thousand of the bet," said Andrew Stuart,as he took his seat, "for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine."The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine.The players took up their cards, but could not keep their eyes off theclock.  Certainly, however secure they felt, minutes had never seemedso long to them!"Seventeen minutes to nine," said Thomas Flanagan, as he cut the cardswhich Ralph handed to him.Then there was a moment of silence.  The great saloon was perfectlyquiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard, with now andthen a shrill cry.  The pendulum beat the seconds, which each playereagerly counted, as he listened, with mathematical regularity."Sixteen minutes to nine!" said John Sullivan, in a voice whichbetrayed his emotion.One minute more, and the wager would be won.  Andrew Stuart and hispartners suspended their game.  They left their cards, and counted theseconds.At the fortieth second, nothing.  At the fiftieth, still nothing.At the fifty-fifth, a loud cry was heard in the street, followed byapplause, hurrahs, and some fierce growls.The players rose from their seats.At the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened; and thependulum had not beat the sixtieth second when Phileas Fogg appeared,followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the clubdoors, and in his calm voice, said, "Here I am, gentlemen!"Chapter XXXVIIIN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT PHILEAS FOGG GAINED NOTHING BY HIS TOURAROUND THE WORLD, UNLESS IT WERE HAPPINESSYes; Phileas Fogg in person.The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in theevening--about five and twenty hours after the arrival of thetravellers in London--Passepartout had been sent by his master toengage the services of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain marriageceremony, which was to take place the next day.Passepartout went on his errand enchanted.  He soon reached theclergyman's house, but found him not at home.  Passepartout waited agood twenty minutes, and when he left the reverend gentleman, it wasthirty-five minutes past eight.  But in what a state he was!  With hishair in disorder, and without his hat, he ran along the street as neverman was seen to run before, overturning passers-by, rushing over thesidewalk like a waterspout.In three minutes he was in Saville Row again, and staggered back intoMr. Fogg's room.He could not speak."What is the matter?" asked Mr. Fogg."My master!" gasped Passepartout--"marriage--impossible--""Impossible?""Impossible--for to-morrow.""Why so?""Because to-morrow--is Sunday!""Monday," replied Mr. Fogg."No--to-day is Saturday.""Saturday?  Impossible!""Yes, yes, yes, yes!" cried Passepartout.  "You have made a mistake ofone day!  We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time; but there areonly ten minutes left!"Passepartout had seized his master by the collar, and was dragging himalong with irresistible force.Phileas Fogg, thus kidnapped, without having time to think, left hishouse, jumped into a cab, promised a hundred pounds to the cabman, and,having run over two dogs and overturned five carriages, reached theReform Club.The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the greatsaloon.Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eightydays!Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds!How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made thiserror of a day?  How came he to think that he had arrived in London onSaturday, the twenty-first day of December, when it was really Friday,the twentieth, the seventy-ninth day only from his departure?The cause of the error is very simple.Phileas Fogg had, without suspecting it, gained one day on his journey,and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward; he would,on the contrary, have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction,that is, westward.In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the daystherefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crosseddegrees in this direction.  There are three hundred and sixty degreeson the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixtydegrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-fourhours--that is, the day unconsciously gained.  In other words, whilePhileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eightytimes, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-ninetimes.  This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday,and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg thought.And Passepartout's famous family watch, which had always kept Londontime, would have betrayed this fact, if it had marked the days as wellas the hours and the minutes!Phileas Fogg, then, had won the twenty thousand pounds; but, as he hadspent nearly nineteen thousand on the way, the pecuniary gain wassmall.  His object was, however, to be victorious, and not to winmoney.  He divided the one thousand pounds that remained betweenPassepartout and the unfortunate Fix, against whom he cherished nogrudge.  He deducted, however, from Passepartout's share the cost ofthe gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twentyhours, for the sake of regularity.That evening, Mr. Fogg, as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever, said toAouda: "Is our marriage still agreeable to you?""Mr. Fogg," replied she, "it is for me to ask that question.  You wereruined, but now you are rich again.""Pardon me, madam; my fortune belongs to you.  If you had not suggestedour marriage, my servant would not have gone to the Reverend SamuelWilson's, I should not have been apprised of my error, and--""Dear Mr. Fogg!" said the young woman."Dear Aouda!" replied Phileas Fogg.It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hoursafter, and that Passepartout, glowing and dazzling, gave the brideaway.  Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?The next day, as soon as it was light, Passepartout rapped vigorouslyat his master's door.  Mr. Fogg opened it, and asked, "What's thematter, Passepartout?""What is it, sir?  Why, I've just this instant found out--""What?""That we might have made the tour of the world in only seventy-eightdays.""No doubt," returned Mr. Fogg, "by not crossing India.  But if I hadnot crossed India, I should not have saved Aouda; she would not havebeen my wife, and--"Mr. Fogg quietly shut the door.Phileas Fogg had won his wager, and had made his journey around theworld in eighty days.  To do this he had employed every means ofconveyance--steamers, railways, carriages, yachts, trading-vessels,sledges, elephants.  The eccentric gentleman had throughout displayedall his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude.  But whatthen?  What had he really gained by all this trouble?  What had hebrought back from this long and weary journey?Nothing, say you?  Perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman, who,strange as it may appear, made him the happiest of men!Truly, would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?End of Project Gutenberg's Around the World in 80 Days, by Jules Verne*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS ******** This file should be named 103.txt or 103.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/103/Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.
